===================================
QT based multitab terminal emulator
===================================

Based on QTermWidget by <e_k@users.sourceforge.net>

Installation:

1. Unpack source

2. cd qterminal

3. You will need qtermwidget sources to successfully build this application.
   Please download them from http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtermwidget and 
   put unpacked `qtermwidget` directory in one hierarchy level with `qterminal` directory.
   Actually get_qtermwidget.sh script will do this for you :)
  
4. Run ./build.sh script. It will apply some patches(probably:) to qtermwidget and compile 
   entire project. Note that QMAKE variable in build.sh script should point to Qt4 qmake executable.
   Alternatively you may directly use qmake build system.

5. Run sudo make install as root.

6. Type qterminal and enjoy :)

NOTE: /qterm/src/config.h contains several options for application shortcut configuration.
      Change them and recompile to override default settings.

TODO: complete configfile-based configuration functionality.
